**Definition of software distribution and its significance**
Software distribution refers to the process of delivering software products, updates, or patches to users or clients. This is a significant aspect of software development since it ensures that users receive new features, bug fixes, or security updates in a timely and efficient manner.

**Different software distribution strategies and their characteristics**
Different software distribution strategies include centralized distribution, where a single source provides the software to users, and decentralized distribution, where multiple sources offer the software. Additionally, there's continuous distribution, which involves frequent, smaller updates, and staged distribution, which involves releasing large updates less frequently. Each strategy has its unique benefits and drawbacks, depending on factors like the size of the user base, the urgency of updates, and the complexity of the software.
