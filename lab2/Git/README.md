# Git 

**Description:**

Git is distributed version control system. It allows teams efficently work simultaneously, manage code and track changes.

**Purpose and Benefits:**

Tracking and maintaining the entire history of file changes, ensuring the convenience of teamwork on the code.

**Key Features and Functionalities:**

- Branching and Merging: Developers can create and manage branches for different features, experiments, or bug fixes. Merging changes from different branches ensures the integrity of the codebase.

- Remote Collaboration: Git supports remote repositories (Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket ...) and provides mechanisms for cloning, pulling, and pushing changes to and from remote locations. 

- Commit History: Git maintains a detailed commit history, allowing developers to track changes, review commit messages, and understand the evolution of the codebase over time.

- Staging Area: Git introduces a staging area (also known as the index) where developers can selectively choose changes to include in the next commit

- Stash: Git introduces stashing uncommited changes to apply them later.

**Use Cases and Examples:**

Developers use Git to track changes, collaborate on code, and manage different versions of the software. All their code stored in git repository.
