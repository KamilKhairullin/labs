**Definition of version control systems and their purpose**

- Software development practice for tracking and managing changes made to code and other files. 
- Version control software facilitates coordination, sharing, and collaboration across the entire software development team. It enables teams to work in distributed and asynchronous environments, \
 manage changes and versions of code and artifacts, and resolve merge conflicts and related anomalies.

**Explanation of the benefits and advantages of using version control in a collaborative environment**

A version control system tracks changes to a file or set of files over time. 

- Quality: Teams can review, comment, and improve each other's code and assets.
- Acceleration: Branch code, make changes, and merge commits faster.
- Visibility: Understand and spark team collaboration to foster greater release build and release patterns. Better visibility improves everything from project management to code quality.

**Overview of different types of version control systems (centralized, distributed, etc.)**

- The most common type is a centralized VCS, which uses a server to store all the versions of a file. Developers can check out a file from the server, make changes, and check the file back in. \
The server then stores the new version of the file. This central repository can be located on a server or on a developer's local machine. Centralized version control systems are typically \
used in software development projects where a team of developers needs to share code and track changes.

- A distributed version control system (DVCS) allows users to access a repository from multiple locations. DVCSs are often used by developers who need to work on projects from multiple computers or \
who need to collaborate with other developers remotely.

- A lock-based version control system uses file locking to manage concurrent access to files and resources. File locking prevents two or more users from making conflicting changes to the same file \
 or resource.

- In an optimistic version control system, every user has their own private workspace. When they want to share their changes with the rest of the team, they submit a request to the server. The server \ 
then looks at all the changes and determines which ones can be safely merged together.

**Comparison of popular version control systems (Git, Subversion, Mercurial, etc.)**

- Git is an open source distributed system that is used for software projects of any size, making it a popular option for startups, enterprise, and everything in between.
- SVN is a widely adopted centralized VCS. This system keeps all of a project's files on a single codeline making it impossible to branch, so it's easy to scale for large projects. It's simple to learn \
and features folder security measures, so access to subfolders can be restricted.
- Mercurial is a distributed VCS that offers simple branching and merging capabilities. The system enables rapid scaling and collaborative development, with an intuitive interface. The flexible command \ 
line interface enables users to begin using the system immediately.
